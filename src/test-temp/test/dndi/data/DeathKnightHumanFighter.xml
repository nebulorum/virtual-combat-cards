Its eyes burn with unholy fire. Beneath its armor, some dry flesh still clings to its bones, but its strength comes from the necromantic energy that animates it, not from its long-dead muscles.<BR></BR><BR></BR>A death knight√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s armor and weapons are the same items it used in life, but their appearance is often transformed into deathly mockeries of their past forms. Its armor is fire-blackened, etched with blasphemous runes, and often adorned with bloodstained spikes. Its weapon√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä?which contains the death knight√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s soul√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä?is still brightly polished but crackles with dark necrotic energy.</P><I>First published in <A href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/217207200">Monster Manual</A>.</I><BR></BR><BR></BR>
